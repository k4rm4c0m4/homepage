					<h1>About me</h1>
					<p>I am an 18 year old computer science student, hoping to enroll in the Technische Universit√§t Berlin this year.
						Currently I am a student at the Technisches Bildungszentrum Mitte in Bremen, Germany.
					</p>
					<p>My main interests in Computing lie in low-level systems development such as operating systems development and
						internet infrastructure. I am also very interested in brain-computer interfacing and analysis of complex systems.
						I hope to one day work at an academic institution and maybe, later in life, teach. Of course I am young, so let'
						hope those hopes won't be crushed all that easily.
					</p>
					<p>Otherwise I am interested in analog synthesis, specficially eletronic music and synthesizers. I have a passion
					   for self-building electronics and self-hosting my own little cloud infrastructure. The very website you're reading
					   was built by hand by me and is hosted on a barebones VPS through caddy. Similarly, I host my own office solution on
					   this domain on docs.simonbusch.info and I even have my own remote development workstation set up on dev.simonbusch.info.
